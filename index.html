<p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid blueviolet;">I accidently pressed F5 after 3 hours.. and now it's been 6 hours almost. 
THE GOOD NEWS IS - I had a lot of fun learning about HTLM and CSSüê±‚Äçüêâ 
BAD NEWS IS - My brain spent 6 hours on that, procrastinating the fact that I actually had to write the js code and somehow magically poof - Works with the input box and button! I have a feeling it's not that hard, but you know.. It was a little motivating, and I didn't have a sigarette even this whole time.. (Eventually I Got H√•vard's code because it really annoyed me that the game didn't work T_T &lt;3)
